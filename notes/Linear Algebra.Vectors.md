## Introduction, in brief
Over the myriad centuries of our blessed lifetimes, we've known vectors as many things: they can be really tall numbers, really squiggly arrows, the only place where a mathematician understands the meaning of the word "bold", and, above all else, the orange jumpsuit guy from Despicable Me who embodies the biological fact that rhombus-shaped human bodies are peak evolution. But now comes a time where we study vectors not as actual *things* - arrays of numbers, directions, arrows - but as abstract math objects, just like what numbers are to us.
