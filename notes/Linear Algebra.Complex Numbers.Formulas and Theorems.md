><span style="background-color: #03cafc; color: black;"> Definition</span> (Modulus and argument). Define the modulus of $z=a+bi$ as $|z|=\sqrt{a^2+b^2}$; this is analogous to the length of its vector representation on the Argand plane. <br/><br/>
Define its argument as the angle its vector makes with the real axis: $\arg z = \tan^{-1}(\frac{b}{a})$. The modulus-argument pair $(r,\theta)$ can uniquely describe a complex number $z$, but each $z$ has infinitely many arguments $\theta+2k\pi$ (a full revolution, but not the French kind). We often take only the principal argument - $-\pi<\theta<\pi$.

> <span style="background-color: #ffb812; color: black;">Proposition.</span> We have
$$z\bar{z}=a^2+b^2 = |z|^2$$ and $$z^{-1}=\frac{\bar{z}}{|z|^2}$$.

> <span style="background-color: #12ffd7; color: black;">Theorem.</span> (Triangle inequality). For any two complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$, we have $|z_1+z_2|\leq |z_1|+|z_2|$.
