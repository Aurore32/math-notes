And so we begin! I suppose this is a better opportunity than any for me to share a profound foreword to the erudite, learned journey of mathematical enlightenment we are about to embark on with linear algebra - namely, to answer the question: why learn linear algebra at all? There are only three reasons. First, you're a massive sci-fi movie nerd and have accidentally stumbled upon the far-inferior version of the Matrix. Second, you're a massive basketball fan and received the worst surprise of your entire life when you searched "Jordan form" on YouTube in hopes of basketball enlightenment. Third, you're a massive German and have taken linear algebra for the sole purpose of pronouncing *eigenvalue* "the German way". Either way, I'm glad you're here with me; after all, if you're destined to become a machine learning dev earning seven figures and sunbathing in a luxury yacht, then - in the eternal words of wisdom of r/animememes - "don't say you love the anime if you haven't read the manga".<br/><br/>
(Of course, besides all these completely unhinged things I'm talking about, I suppose there's also a few nuggets of mathematical beauty to be found in these curious morsels we call vectors and matrices here and there.)
