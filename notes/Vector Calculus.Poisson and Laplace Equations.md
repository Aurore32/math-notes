> Poisson made groundbreaking strides in the investigation of potential fields in physics, asking "what if $\nabla^2 V = f$?". Laplace made the equally groundbreaking stride of being a gigantic wuss and pretending like $f$ didn't exist. Naturally, the operator $\nabla^2$ is now known far and wide as the Laplacian.
