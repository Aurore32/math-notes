> <span style="background-color: #03cafc; color: black;">Definition</span> (Vector subspace). We say that $U$ is a subspace of a vector space $V$ if $U \subseteq V$ and $U$ is also a vector space under the same operations (addition and scalar multiplication). <br/><br/>
Of the subspaces of $V$, $V$ and $\{0\}$ are trivially subspaces; the other subspaces are **proper subspaces**. <br/><br/>
If $U$ is a subspace of $V$, then by the definition of a vector space, $U$ must also be **closed under addition and scalar multiplication**:
that is, for $\mathbf{a,b}\in U$ and some scalar $\lambda$, we have
1. $\mathbf{a+b}\in U$
2. $\lambda\mathbf{a} \in U$
3. $\mathbf{0} \in U$. 
<br/><br/>
In other words, $U$ is closed under linear transformation $\lambda\mathbf{a}+\mu\mathbf{b}$.
