What the frick did you just fricking say about me, you little starting condition? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the MIT, and I’ve been initiated in numerous secret techniques on Al-Gebra, and I have over 300 confirmed integrations. I am trained in gorilla mathematics and I’m the top math wiz in the entire set of US computational forces. You are nothing to me but just another differential equation. I will solve you the frick out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fricking definitions. You think you can get away with simplifying that fraction that way over the Internet? Think again, factorial. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of underground mathematicians across the world and your domain is being traced right now so you better prepare for the tangent, maggot. The tangent that wipes out that little unknown variable you call your life.You’re fricking summed, sequence. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can solve you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with WolframAlpha. Not only am I extensively trained in calculating by hand, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Texas Instruments Calculator Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable $\frac{dy}{dx}$'s off the face of the page, you little inkstain. If only you could have known what unholy differentiation your little “partial derivative” problem was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your exponential range. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn second-order ordinary differential equation with boundary conditions. I will prove fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re solved dead, limit.
