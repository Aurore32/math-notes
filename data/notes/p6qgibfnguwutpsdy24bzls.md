> <span style="background-color: #03cafc; color: black;">Definition</span> (Roots of unity). We refer to the complex roots of the equation $\omega^n=1$ as the *nth roots of unity*; as this is a polynomial of deg $n$, we have $n$ roots of unity, which can be completely described by 
$$
\omega=e^{\frac{2\pi ki}{n}},\ k=0,1,2,3,...,(n-1).
$$
> As a consequence of the above, we also have 
$$
        \sum \omega = 1+e^{\frac{2\pi i}{n}} + e^{\frac{4\pi i}{n}} + ... + e^{\frac{2(n-1)\pi i}{n}} = 0
$$
