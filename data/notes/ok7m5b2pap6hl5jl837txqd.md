The big cheese.

Normal equations - the ones we grew up with, ones of the form $x+5=10$ or $2x+3=5$ or "solve for $t$ in $e^{-t} = 0$, where $t$ is the time elapsed before your dad comes back with the milk - describe what things are like now: the $x$ in $x+5=10$, for instance, is equal to $5$ now, and it always will be. Differential equations, in contrast, describe how things change over time; instead of finding a single solution that tells us what it is at that present moment, we have to find a function that, at all times, is related to its own rate of change in some meaningful way - something necessitated in nearly every realm of the real world, from an object whose air resistance depends on its own speed of motion, to a disease which spreads more quickly the more people it infects.

So what do partial differential equations do? Things in the real world don't just change based on one variable alone; we live in three dimensions, not two, and the models we need to model that three-dimensional world also needs to be three-dimensional. PDEs give us the ability to express relationships not only through the rate of change of something based on a single variable, but based on multiple variables - space and time, instead of one or the other.
