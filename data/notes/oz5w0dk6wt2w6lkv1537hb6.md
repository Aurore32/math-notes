A **second-order** ordinary differential equation in $x$ and $y$ is one whose highest-order derivative of $y$ is the second derivative. Most methods that apply to second-order ODEs also apply to higher-order equations as well. 

> <span style="background-color: #03cafc; color: black;">Definition</span>. A **linear** second-order ODE is one that does not have any higher powers of $y, y', y''$ beyond the 1st power. As non-linear second-order ODEs are difficult to discuss analytically, the following sections will focus on solutions to linear ODEs.

> <span style="background-color: #03cafc; color: black;">Definition</span>. **Homogeneous** second-order ODEs are ones that can be written in the form $P(x)y'' + Q(x)y' + R(x) = 0$ (RHS is 0); inhomogeneous equations are such that the RHS is non-zero (some function of $x$).

As discussed, once the corresponding homogeneous equation has been solved, the inhomogeneous equation soon follows; the more fundamental problem is the solution of the inhomogeneous equation.
