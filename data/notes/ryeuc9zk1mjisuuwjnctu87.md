> The normal vector to a plane is a vector which has exactly nothing in common with any vector on the plane. The normal distribution is a distribution that somehow manages to pull $e$ and $\pi$ out of its ass even without being named after Euler. The normal subgroup is a subgroup that satisfies the extremely intuitive and not-at-all whack-ass condition of $gHg^{-1} = H$. I'm starting to feel like mathematicians actually have no idea what the word "normal" means.
